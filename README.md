# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Several machine learning models such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree and SVM to predict wine quality. I tried to predict based ony on the red wine data. Furthermore, evaluation metrics was used to find the best predictor.

# A sample of the dataset

Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb provides a step by step process on how to explore, clean and apply feature engineering on the data to find the best features which will make an impact on the accuracy of the models.
